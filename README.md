### Problems face: 
+ Make the GUI interface accept the values with boundary checking
### Why I enjoyed it: 
+ Being able to mess with the color scheme and theming with Windows 
+ Tweaking it until I got the full result 
### Would change/add: 
+ Implelent a clear value button like other people added to their NumberTheory Gui interface. 
+ Fixed Window Size instead of it being dynamic 
+ Menubar
